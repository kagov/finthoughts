Hi I am Kaushik and welcome to my blog - Thoughts on finance. This is a place where I write about my findings and learnings in the world of finance, economy and investing. The information presented here are solely my understanding and should not be condisered as completely true. Please verify from authentic sources. 

I am a software developer and am almost always about new tech. I also blog at [Lcy](https://letsconfigyou.com). This is about my explorations in the world of software and I try to put content that might help a soul or two.

When I am not writing code or building stuff for my organization I work on my side project. Currently I am building a webapp that enables programmers to understand code, fill in the blanks and finally grasp the logic behind the solution. I believe when a software dev begins his/her journey they usually get lost in the syntax and semantics of the language itself. The app lets you focus only on logic and not worry about the syntax itself. Once you are comfortable feel free to exit the platform and build from scratch.
