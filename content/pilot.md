Welcome to my thoughts on Finance. This is a space where I let out some of my learnings on the money world and a little bit of economics. I do not mean to provide you advice or any actionable items but if you have gained something out of this then I will be delighted.

Through this medium I also wish to compare and contrast the economy of India and that of USA and what are the key moving parts in these two giants. 

This is my first post I want to write something about printing money and why is that not the solution to all the problems or atleast most of the problems. 

Imagine I want to buy a Tesla Model X and let us roughly assume it costs around $100,000. Now in a normal scenario one would usually borrow some money from a bank and then purchase the car and they would make montly payments for certain amount of time. Now imagine the federal govenrment decides to print out 100 dollar bills and hand out 1000 of them to each individual, they can certainly run the printing press in on full throttle and do that, but take a moment and think what would happen.

Thousands of other people who are fans of the Tesla machine would rush to the stores and get one for themselves right. But does Tesla have the necessary resources to meet that demand, can it handle this surge and deliver these many cars. What would be next logical step. Tesla would hike up the prices and try to bring the situation under control. This will be case for all the private sector industries and every commodity from a loaf of bread to something as big as a house would cost you a thousand times more. Since,everyone has 100,000 dollars smaller bills like $1 and $5 will slowly start losing value and this brings us to the answer of the question.

**Money cannot be simply printed because it has no intrinsic value.** A currency note is only valuable if the government says so otherwise its just a piece of paper with some digits and faces on it. Money is valuable if the federal bank has trust in it. **Hyper-inflation** occurs when there is a huge increase in the price of goods and one of the reasons can be excessive cash flow in the economy. How does the government make sure we do not have hyper-inflation..?
